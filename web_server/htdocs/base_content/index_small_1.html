	In a quiet village, a young boy named Liam found a peculiar stone glowing faintly in the forest. It was smooth, warm, and hummed softly when held. Curious, he brought it home, but strange things began to happen. At night, the stone glowed brighter, and whispers echoed through his room.

One evening, unable to resist the whispers, Liam followed them back to the forest. The stone pulsed in his hand, guiding him to a hidden clearing where an ancient oak stood. The tree’s bark parted, revealing a shimmering portal.

Stepping through, Liam found a world filled with floating islands and glowing creatures. The stone spoke: “You are the chosen one to protect this realm.” Though scared, Liam nodded. He had always longed for adventure, and now, he was part of one.

With the stone as his guide, Liam embarked on a journey that would change him forever.
