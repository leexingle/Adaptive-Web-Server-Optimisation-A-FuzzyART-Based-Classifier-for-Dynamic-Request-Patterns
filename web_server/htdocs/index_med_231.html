	The Forgotten City

Amara had always been a dreamer, but nothing in her wildest imagination prepared her for the day she stumbled upon the Forgotten City. She was an archaeologist by trade, albeit a struggling one. Her most recent excavation had ended disastrously when funding was pulled, leaving her with nothing but broken equipment and unanswered questions.

It was during her solitary trek through the dense jungles of Alarion that she found it. The trees parted suddenly, revealing a sprawling city, its towering spires blanketed in emerald moss and entwined with the roots of ancient trees. Stone carvings adorned every wall, depicting strange symbols and scenes of people bowing before glowing obelisks. Amara’s heart raced.

The city was alive—not in the literal sense, but in the way it exuded a presence, as though watching her every move. She approached cautiously, her boots crunching on the overgrown cobblestones. As she reached what appeared to be the central plaza, she saw it: a massive obelisk standing tall amidst a dry fountain. Its surface shimmered faintly, even in the muted sunlight.

Amara pulled out her notebook and began sketching the structure, her fingers trembling. The carvings around the obelisk were unlike any she’d seen before, with intricate spirals that seemed to shift when viewed from different angles. She reached out, her fingers brushing its surface.

The world tilted.

The Awakening

When Amara opened her eyes, the city was different. The moss and vines were gone, replaced by gleaming stone and bustling streets. People in flowing robes moved with purpose, their skin glowing faintly as if lit from within. She stood in the same plaza, but now the fountain flowed with a shimmering liquid that defied gravity, cascading upward in mesmerizing arcs.

Before she could gather her thoughts, a man approached her. His eyes were a piercing silver, and his voice carried an otherworldly resonance. “You shouldn’t be here,” he said.

Amara stammered. “I—I don’t know how I got here. Who are you?”

“I am Solan, Keeper of the Nexus,” he replied, his gaze scrutinizing her. “You’ve activated the Veil. Few outsiders possess the connection required to awaken it.”

“The Veil?” she echoed, confused.

Solan gestured toward the obelisk. “The obelisks are anchors, bridging our reality with yours. You’ve crossed into our time—our city as it was before the Collapse.”

Amara’s mind raced. If what Solan said was true, she had traveled centuries into the past. The implications were staggering. “Why me?” she asked.

“That is the question,” Solan said, his expression unreadable. “Come. The Council must decide what to do with you.”

The Council’s Judgment

Amara was led to a grand hall where a circular table sat at its center. Around it were nine figures, their features as ethereal as Solan’s. They debated her fate in hushed tones, their voices echoing in her mind more than in her ears.

“She is an anomaly,” one of them said.

“But perhaps she is the answer,” countered another.

Finally, the eldest of the group spoke. “The Veil does not act without purpose. If it chose her, she has a role to play. The Collapse is imminent, and she may be the key to preventing it.”

Amara stepped forward. “What is the Collapse?”

The elder’s expression darkened. “It is the end of our world, the moment the obelisks fail and the Nexus shatters. Our city falls into ruin, and our people are lost to time.”

“And you think I can stop it?” Amara asked, doubt creeping into her voice.

“We believe you must,” the elder said.

The Journey

Amara was tasked with reactivating three dormant obelisks scattered across the city, each tied to a specific element: Fire, Water, and Air. Solan was her guide, though his cryptic explanations often left her with more questions than answers.

The first obelisk stood in a cavern beneath the city, surrounded by molten lava. Amara’s heart pounded as she leapt from platform to platform, the heat searing her skin. At its base, she found a mechanism that required her to align symbols in a precise sequence. With Solan’s help, she deciphered the puzzle and reactivated the obelisk.

The second obelisk was submerged in an underwater temple. Amara donned an ancient breathing apparatus provided by Solan and descended into the depths. She fought against the currents and narrowly escaped the jaws of a serpent-like creature guarding the obelisk.

The final obelisk was atop a spire so high it pierced the clouds. The climb was treacherous, the winds threatening to hurl her into the abyss. At the summit, she faced her greatest challenge: a vision of her own past. She saw herself as a child, standing over her parents’ graves. The pain threatened to overwhelm her, but she pressed on, placing her hand on the obelisk to complete the activation.

The Nexus

With all three obelisks reactivated, the Nexus in the central plaza began to pulse with energy. Amara and Solan returned to find the Council waiting.

“You’ve done it,” the elder said. “But there is one final task.”

The obelisks needed a life force to stabilize the Nexus, and Solan revealed that he had been chosen for this sacrifice long ago. Amara protested, but Solan was resolute. “It is my duty,” he said, his silver eyes softening.

As Solan merged with the Nexus, the city trembled. A wave of light burst forth, erasing the decay and returning the city to its former glory. Amara shielded her eyes, and when she opened them, she was back in the overgrown ruins.

The obelisks were silent once more, but the city felt different. Alive.

Amara knew she could never share her story—no one would believe her. But she carried the memory of Solan and the people of the Forgotten City, vowing to protect their legacy.
